  "text": "Building from the projectile system I structured enemy states in a similar way. Enemies have actions that can be strung together as schedules and loops. Enemy AI differs though by being state governed where each state has a condition that must be met to end the state, with a setup and OnUpdate method in each. States also have a priority that is taking into account when determining the next action in a Utility based AI system In the future I will add conditions that must be met for the action to be called (e.g a previous state has been actioned)",
