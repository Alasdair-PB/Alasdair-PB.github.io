  "text": "When working on the Hint System I looked into creating Editor modules and customizing the Developer facing Data asset view. In the project as of now there is only a dropdown and a button to create the template for a Hint type, but Iâ€™m looking to expand this in the future to make it easier to define Hint Types in the required logic order. As a final task for this project I looked at hooking up other team members' code & creating a quick object pooling system for the instantiated briefcases so it would be easier to recycle existing game objects instead of instantiated and destroying new/existing ones.
