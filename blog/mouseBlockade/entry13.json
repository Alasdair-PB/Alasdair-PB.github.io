  "name": "Putting Cat Blockade on hold.",
  "text": "Why? After learning better code habits, between interview coding tests, tutorials & practice on Cat blockade, I have also become far more critical of my earlier code. Additionally, Playtesting Cat blockade was becoming increasingly difficult as a single developer. While I still believe the end result may have been enjoyable, game balance had no chance of being properly managed.Moving forward I’d want to start from a new base, but for now Cat Blockade will be on hold while I work on more single dev oriented projects. I’m looking forward to one day continuing this project in the future as I am still incredibly passionate about the concept. ",
