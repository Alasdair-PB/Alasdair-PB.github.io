  "text": "The player is now able to set the characters to CPU and adjust player count based on the active game mode. Team colors and skin options have also been added for future implementation. This UI was designed to follow modular rules where new games mode can be added simply by creating new scriptable objects with variable parameters. UI then scales correctly with intended rules in place to quicken gamemode testing and development. All UI elements are added in code for dynamic content/ layouts. All UI art assets are still temporary until models have all their textures for a final render :) ",
