  "text": "During development it quickly became apparent that mice could get trapped underneath blocks. From this the drill mechanic was designed and the signature look of the mice was created. The mice can drill in any direction, but will rebound off walls when drilling towards a border block. Mice will be able to obtain items by drilling into item blocks that have a rare chance of spawning in each block placed by the cat. This ability also brings the potential for direction blocks in the future that will turn the mice automatically if the mice drill into them- allowing the cat to create traps that redirect the mice into spike blocks.",
