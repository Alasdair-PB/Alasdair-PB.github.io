  "text": "As part of my role in the group project I set up a Component system with elements of a ECS design philosophy, storing all components in buffers by types allowing systems to quickly iterate over Components. In addition, I configured this system to work as part of the networked game loop including INetworkComponents and variations that can send events, delta & full packets. To set this up I also reworked the client server base system from the previous module to properly support player spawning and client connection. Check out ComponentManager.h, NetworkedGame.cpp, and IComponent.h/ INetworkComponent.h on the github for an overview and explore our wiki page for a breakdown on how to use it.",
