  "text": "During this project I also made sure to help others in my teams by working with them to create feature plans and integrate systems together. As part of this I hooked the InventorySystem with the PlayerController to make players able to pick up items and worked with our UI developer to switch to a pushdown automata system to allow menus to be stacked & backtracked. To keep track of tasks I also set up a group Jira board & performed multiple code reviews and PRs on features before they went through into main. As a result we had practically no issues when merging features and working together to integrate systems.",
