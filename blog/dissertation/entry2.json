  "text": "To set up for deformation Iâ€™m using a voxel map to define my terrain. In a voxel map each point defines the offset from the ground level known as an isolevel. To render this data as geometry I use the marching cubes algorithm that transverses this data and checks for cases where an above ground point neighbours below ground points. This check is done for each cell, where a cell has 8 corner values. A case table is then used to determine what geometry is suitable for all active corners. This is the basics of marching cubes.",
