  "text": "An octree divides the voxel body into different leaves that subdivide further based on a determining factor. For this Dissertation, the Octree divides based on the player's distance from the camera. This Level of detail (LOD) system using Octree allows voxel bodies closer to the player to be rendered in higher detail while distant objects to be rendered in lower detail. When rendering the voxel data we can provide just the relevent leaf nodes to the system.",
