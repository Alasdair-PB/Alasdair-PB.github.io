  "text": "To get my base version of the marching cubes algorithm I created two compute shaders, one to generate the isovalues on startup and the other to get the vertex data from the marching cubes algorithm. In the isoValue generator pass, I am simply setting isoValue by distance from the center- forming the sphere you can see on screen. In my marching cubes pass, each node writes to a vertex buffer that is returned from a callback and used to create a UProcedural mesh each frame.",
