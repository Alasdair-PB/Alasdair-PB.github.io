  "name": "Marching cubes",
  "text": "Marching cubes (MC) is an algorithm that utilizes a grid of points to represent points above a set isolevel. Using MC we can render out a surface for each point above the isolevel. To make this possible in unreal compute shaders were employed to dispatch a shader that performs marching cubes on each leaf in the Octree. The compute shader is an async operation dispatched to the GPU, freeing up our CPU for better suited actions. Once Marching cubes is completed the output indicies and vertices are returned in a buffer that can be passed to a UProcedural mesh.",
